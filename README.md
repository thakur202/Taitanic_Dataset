Titanic Dataset predict how many people survived 

#### project :- Titanic Dataset
#### Domain  :- Classification
#### Description :
             This Dataset given passanger information like passangerID , Survived , Passanger class ,
             name of passanger , sex , Age , ,family(sibsp , parch), ticket ,fare , cabin , Embrarked 
             this type of columns and predict the model how many passanger Survived and not Survived .

#### Role and Responsibilities :-
                          * Understand , Analyze dataset
                          * Analyze dataset how many passanger Survived based on Sex , Age , 
                                          Family(sibsp , parch) , and Embrarked 
                          * Predict the model based on DecisionTreeClassifier and Logistic regression
                          * After predict model creat Dataframe based on two columns first one 
                                          is PassangerId and second one is Survived
